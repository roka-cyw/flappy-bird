# TO DO

## Fix bugs and Investigate

    + Break down to diff files
    - Game work after failing (after restart)
    > Collision has to affect not only center of bird
    - Check **game over** value

    - Investigate about JS and UI treads
    - isPointCollidingWithReact understand it

## Own updates

    > Paint the pipe in case of a collision
    - Change **day** to **night** background
    + Fill **Group** element (Now only 1 bird, have to be 3)
    - Upd physics (More like the original)
    - Use assets for counter
    - Move floor like pipes
    - Add default screen (bird fly but user see image or smth. I have asset **message** for that)
    - Add game over message
    - Add table score after dying

    - Add shop with birds
