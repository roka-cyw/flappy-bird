# TO DO

## Fix bugs

    - Break down to diff files
    - Game work after failing (after restart)
    - Collision has to affect not only center of bird
    - Check **game over** value
    - Fill **Group** element (Now only 1 bird, have to be 3)
    - Upd physics (More like the original)

    - Investigate about JS and UI treads
    - isPointCollidingWithReact understand it
    - Read about circle and square collision

## Own updates

    - Change **day** to **night** background
    - Paint the pipe in case of a collision
    - Use assets for counter
    - Move floor like pipes
    - Add default screen (bird fly but user see image or smth. I have asset **message** for that)
    - Add game over message
    - Add table score after dying

    - Add shop with birds
    - Add loading screen

    - Database for checking score
